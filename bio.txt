I am Tahani Edea B. Usman I am 16 years old, I was born on September 5, 2002. I lived in Cotabato City where I was born and raised. I am a grade 11 student in the STEM strand, I currently study in Notre Dame RVM College of Cotabato since I was still in 7th grade until now that I am grade 11. 
My dream or ambition is to be a Nurse or Accountant, when I was still a child my dream was to be a Doctor but it is impossible for me to achieve that dream. I want to be an nurse or accountant but I chosed STEM strand than ABM strand which I regret because my friends told me so, I reegret why I chose STEM strand because I was too unfortunate to be in my current section. I have a fear of blood or hemophobia but I want to be a nurse and I have to overcome my fear. And my greatest Dream is to be succesful to travel in South Korea and other countries like Japan, And to help my Parents and siblings. 

My personality is comlipicated that even me hates it. I am a kind person because I am quiet who likes to listen to others storiess than to tell stories. I observe person's characteristic of how she acts towards me and how I treat them is the reflection of how they treat me, but when a person is not kind or do not treat me good I prefer to be good to them than to be rude. I am a person who overthinks all the time because I look often on the negative side than the positive side of my life. I think I am the definition of unlucky. My saying in life is "One must live the way one thinks, or end up thinking the way one has live"
